[*SparkX Qwiic GPS - Titan X1 (SPX-14312)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14312)

The Qwiic GPS uses the Titan X1 GPS module with special I2C firmware. This library talks to the GPS module over I2C.

We recommend using the [TinyGPS++ library](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus) in addition to this library. Works like a champ together.

Library written by Nathan Seidle ([SparkFun](http://www.sparkfun.com)).
